The graph above illustrates the 5 cities and proposed connections between them. The periodized fixed costs for the construction and value of travel time for the direct trip between 2 cities are displayed along with the edge. 

We also have the 2 tabs showing the expected number of passengers travelling between cities and the construction budget. 

The model objective to minimize travelling time between cities, while ensures the flow conservation and construction cost under budget.

A part of the output from this model, which is the built connections is brought to the line planning problem, as input.
